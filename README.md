# My Computer Science Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning repository!

This space is dedicated to my ongoing journey through computer science topics and practical challenges, mainly related to my college coursework, certificate programs, and personal practice. I use this repository to track my progress, organize my solutions, and reflect on what I've learned.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

- âœ… **SQL Practice**  
  Solutions to problems from platforms like HackerRank, where Iâ€™ve been working through various difficulty levels to improve my database querying skills.

- âœ… **College Assignments & Mini Projects**  
  Code and documentation from academic projects, labs, and practicals.

- âœ… **Certificate Challenge Solutions**  
  Files and screenshots related to coding challenges or assessments completed during certification programs.

- âœ… **Screenshots & Notes**  
  Helpful visual references from my completed challenges, and notes Iâ€™ve taken from online tutorials (especially from YouTube when I needed help).

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Created This Repository

As a student, I believe in learning by doing. This repository helps me:
- Keep track of everything Iâ€™m working on
- Build a public record of my growth and consistency
- Share my work with others, including recruiters or mentors
- Get comfortable with Git and GitHub, which are industry standards

## ðŸš€ What's Next

Iâ€™ll continue updating this repo as I learn moreâ€”especially as I go deeper into topics like:
- Database management
- Problem-solving through code
- Web development and tools

Feel free to explore the files, and if you have any tips or feedback, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

Thanks for stopping by!
